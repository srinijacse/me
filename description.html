        <p style="color: blue;font-style:italic;">Sikkim, the least populated state in India, located amidst the Himalayas, bordered by Bhutan to the east, Nepal to the West, West Bengal to the south and Tibet to the North is perhaps one among the most beautiful and richly cultured states of our nation. With 11 official languages and a wide range of rituals the state has managed to preserve its heritage and simplicity till the very date.</p>
